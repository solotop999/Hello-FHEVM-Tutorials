# 🌐 Understand the Basics of FHEVM

## 🔑 What is Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)?
FHE enables **computations on encrypted data** without decryption.  
Data remains private even while being processed on-chain.  

**Workflow:**
1. 📨 User submits encrypted input.  
2. ⚙️ Smart contract executes on ciphertext.  
3. 🔐 Result stays encrypted → only the user can decrypt.  

## 🔄 Data Flow in FHEVM

```
User (👤)  
   |  
   |  (1) Encrypted Input  
   v  
+-------------------------+  
|   🔒 Smart Contract     |  
|   (FHEVM Execution)     |  
+-------------------------+  
   |  
   |  (2) Encrypted Result  
   v  
User (👤)  
   |  
   |  (3) Decrypt locally  
   v  
Plaintext Output (Visible only to User)

## 🕵️ Why It Matters
- **Protects privacy:** inputs/outputs hidden from others.  
- **Practical use cases:** on-chain voting, private DeFi, gaming, AI.  
- **Next-gen dApps:** transparency of blockchain + personal confidentiality.  

---

## 🚀 Why Now?
- Compliance and regulation demand privacy.  
- Enterprises need safe ways to handle sensitive data.  
- Web3 users expect both **trust** and **confidentiality**.  

---

## 🌟 Key Advantages
- **Zero-Trust:** even operators cannot see user data.  
- **Composable:** works with existing Solidity contracts.  
- **Scalable:** fits DeFi, DAOs, healthcare, AI, and more.
